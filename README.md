# svgassembler

Combine individual ```.svg``` files into one big ```.svg``` file, placing the subplots programatically (i.e. set ```x,y```coordinates and it prints the subplot there).
This makes the subplots automatically evenly spaced and aligned, hopefully saving some headaches in inkscape, omnigraffle etc.
